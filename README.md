# Flask API

## Overview
This is a simple Flask API that provides RESTful endpoints for handling requests. The API is designed to be lightweight and easy to extend.

## Features
- Simple and lightweight
- RESTful API structure
- JSON-based responses
- Easy to extend with additional routes

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-flask-api.git
   cd your-flask-api
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the API

Start the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

By default, the API will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## API Endpoints

### Health Check

```
Response:

```

## Environment Variables

```
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```
